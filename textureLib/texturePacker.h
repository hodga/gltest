/*
Texture packer is used in these steps:
1. add images as filenames and check getPackedImageDimensions()
2. remove images if the dimensions become too large
3. pack images
4.1 get packed image data to use with asset instances
4.2 get packed image and packed image dimensions to add as a texture in a asset or store as a file
